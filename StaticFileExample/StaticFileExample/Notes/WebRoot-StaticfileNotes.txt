WEB ROOT and USESTATIC FILES
							
		wwwroot folder :

								// if there is only "wwwroot" folder and files are present in this folder then just use,

								 app.UseStaticFiles();



		Custom Name for wwwroot :

								// if we change the name of wwwroot name, then we have configure the default settings in  WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);  to recognize the folder

			var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(new WebApplicationOptions()
				{
					 // this works only for one custom folder
						WebRootPath = "myroot"   //set the path by giving folder name
				})

								// but also we have to create a dummy "wwwroot" folder to run the custom-root folder, if it is not there then we will have an exception


		Multiple wwwroot :

								// for Multiple wwwroot folder
								// we have to use another app.UseStaticFile, bcz one is alreday used by "WebRootPath"

				app.UseStaticFiles(new StaticFileOptions(){
    				FileProvider = new PhysicalFileProvider(
        				Path.Combine(builder.Environment.ContentRootPath,"mywebroot"))
        				});


						    //  using concatination
		 // new PhysicalFileProvider(builder.Environment.ContentRootPath+"\\mywebroot")

					//StaticFileOptions(){} --> it is a property
				   //  ContentRootPath --> represents the current working directory path


		// if a static files contains in more than one folder then that "UseStaticFile()" middleware executed which will occur at first
